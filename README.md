+ Project summary: In this project, we created a baseline model to generate predicted high resolution images from original low resolution images. Then, we tried to use Convolutional Neural Network to improve the performance of our existing model.
	
**Contribution statement**:

All members designed the study for baseline model. Izzy Beers, Yimeng Qiu, Binhan Wang, and Yaxin Wang created initial versions of functions being called. Yen-Hsiang Chen improved `feature` and created `superResolution`. Yaxin Wang and Yimeng Qiu extracted the features from training images. Binhan Wang tuned the paramters, trained the model for baseline, and evaluated the performace for the baseline model. Yen-Hsiang Chen improved the speed of the baseline model. Yimeng Qiu designed and created the CNN improved model.

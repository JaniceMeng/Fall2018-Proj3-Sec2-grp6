# Project: Can you unscramble a blurry image? 

### CNN Model subfolder

This folder contains files to generate convolutional neural network model for this project.

`ADS project3.ipynb` is the file report containing the entire CNN model.

`srcnn.h5` is the file of weights used in CNN model which is later called into `ADS project3.ipynb`.
